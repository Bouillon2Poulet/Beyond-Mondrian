<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We worked as a team of 3 on this "Thomas was alone" like game. <i>Beyond Mondrian</i> uses basic functionalities of  Mike Bithell's original game and takes them further by adding new stuffs such as levels, moving platform, musics and visual elements.
Created for an IMAC school project, we are proud to present you the fruit of a one month labour :smile:
We also want to shout out Steeve and Enguerrand who has been great helps during the development.

This README will help you through installation and use of <i>Beyond Mondrian</i>. It has been done thanks to <a href="https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template">othneildrew's Best README Template</a>, big up :smile:

### Built With
Because we worked on Linux (Ubuntu and Mint) for this project, we advice you to do the same as long as we don't realy know how it will react on other OS.

* [C](https://www.learn-c.org/)
* [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [make](https://linuxhint.com/install-make-ubuntu/)
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* First of all, let's upgrade our all outdated packages with :
```sh
npm sudo apt update
```

In order to compile our source code, we'll need to install :
* gcc compiler and make
  ```sh
  npm sudo apt install build-essential
  ```

* OpenGL library
```sh
npm sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```

* SDL2 and all its libraries
```sh
npm sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-gfx-1.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-net-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0
```


### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bouillon2Poulet/TeamGolem
   ```

2. Make clean and make main
* at the root of the TeamGolem folder :
  ```sh
  make clean
  ```
  ```sh
  make main
  ```

## Play

In order to play to <i>Beyond Mondrian</i>, you will have to execute from terminal the bin/main.out file.
at the root of the TeamGolem folder :
  ```sh
  ./bin/main.out
  ```

<!-- QUICK GUIDE TO DEVELOPERS-->
## Quick guide to developers

For those who may want to fork our game in order to create their own, we will describe shortly in this part how our game actualy works !

### Window and scene
The window is create thanks to SDL2 lib as we can see in main with :
  ```c
  SDL_Window* window;
  ```
It will also help us by giving us time since the window opened with :
  ```c
  SDL_GetTicks();
  ```

We do draw our scenes and cubes thanks to OpenGL lib
*Setup
  ```c
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
  glLoadIdentity();
  ```
*Draw
  ```c
  glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN);
  glColor3f(float r, float g, float b);
  glVertex2f(int x, int y);
  ```

Players and obstacles are based on Cube struct.
Decorative lines are based on Line struct.

### Players

### Camera

### Quadtree and collisions
The collision system is based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Quadtree</a> which allows to calculate collisions only with near objects.<br>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Quadtree_arbre.png/400px-Quadtree_arbre.png" alt="QuadtreePicture" width="400" height="206">
  </a>

The source code of the Quadtree is homemade, it's all in the quadtree.c file.
*Struct
```c
typedef struct QuadTree {
    float x;
    float y;
    float width;
    float height;
    struct QuadTree* nodes[4];
    Cube* cubes;
    int nbCubes;
    int isLeaf;
} QuadTree;
```

*Functions
```c
QuadTree createQuadTree(float x, float y, float width, float height);
void splitQuadTree(QuadTree* quadTree);
int checkQuadTreeCollision(Cube cube, QuadTree quadTree);
void generateQuadTree(QuadTree* quadTree);
void findPlayerQuadTree(QuadTree* quadTree, Player player, std::vector<QuadTree*> &playerQuadTree);
```

### Textures
Textures are loaded from ./assets/textImages folder with

  ```c
  (screen.c) loadTextureScreen(int indexTexture, Screen screen)
  ```
that returns an SDL_Surface binded to a GLuint Texture :
  ```c
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture);
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, surface->w, surface->h, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, surface->pixels);
    glEnable(GL_BLEND);
    glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA,GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0);
    return texture;
  ```

The SDL_Surface itself it generated thanks with SDL_Surface* IMG_Load(). It uses lodepng.c which allows us to use png but this is kind of black magic :smile:
